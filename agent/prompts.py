ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Look at the current message for explicit intent keywords
2. Consider the conversation context - are they continuing a previous request?
3. Extract any parameters mentioned in the current message
4. Determine if you have enough information to fulfill the intent
5. If missing required information, set needs_clarification=true with a helpful message

IMPORTANT: 
- Only extract parameters that are explicitly mentioned in the current message
- Don't invent or assume values not stated by the user
- Be conservative - better to ask for clarification than make wrong assumptions
- Numbers can be written as digits (2, 4) or words (two, four)
- Booking references are usually alphanumeric codes
